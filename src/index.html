    <h4 style="text-align: left;">A wise and frugal government, which
      shall restrain men from injuring one
      another, shall leave them otherwise
      free to regulate their own pursuits of
      industry and improvement, and shall
      not take from the mouth of labor the
      bread it has earned; this is the sum of
      good government.</h4>

    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <h3 style="text-align: left;"><img src="arrow.png"/>The Future of Eatonville</span></h3>
    <p>Let's celebrate our unique town's history
      and culture.<br/><br/>
      <strong>Action:</strong> I will work to retain the unique
      characteristics that make our town a great
      place to live, work, and visit while charting
      a common-sense course for Eatonville's
      future prosperity.
      </p>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;"><img src="arrow.png"/> Cooperation</h3>
    <p>On behalf of all residents, the council must
      put aside petty bickering and self-serving
      grandstanding. Disagreements naturally
      arise, but discourse should remain civil.
      <br/><br/>
      <strong>Action:</strong> I will maintain good relations with
      the mayor, town employees, and my fellow
      council members.
      </p>
  </td>
  <td style="vertical-align: top;">
    <h3 style="text-align: left;"><img src="arrow.png"/> Crime & Public Safety</h3>
    <p>The first duty of government is to protect its
      citizens.
      
      <br/><br/>
      <strong>Action:</strong>  I will strongly support our police
      department and their efforts to keep our
      town safe.
      </p>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;"><img src="arrow.png"/> Private Property Rights</h3>
    <p>It's obvious but worth repeating - your
      property is yours. Town building regulations
      should be clear and easy to understand, and
      permit approvals should be made quickly
      without overburdening property owners
      <br/><br/>
      <strong>Action:</strong> : I will work diligently to remove
      unnecessary regulation and streamline town
      processes.      
      </p>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;"><img src="arrow.png"/> Pro-Business</h3>
    <p>Eatonville businesses are an asset to our
      town.      
      <br/><br/>
      <strong>Action:</strong> I will encourage local businesses and
      promote a pro-business climate to help them
      succeed.      
      </p>
      <h3 style="text-align: left;"><img src="arrow.png"/> Taxes and Fees</h3>
    <p>Necessary services cost money, and taxes
      must be levied to pay for them.      
      <br/><br/>
      <strong>Action:</strong>  I will scrutinize unnecessary "nice to
      have" projects and, in most cases, not
      support funding them with tax dollars.
